MissingOutputException in rule get_inventory in file /mnt/c/Users/rober/DroughtIndex_aLaRiffamonas/workflow/Snakefile, line 31:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/ghcnd-invenotry.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: ghcnd-inventory.txt, ghcnd-stations.txt, ghcnd_all.tar.gz, ghcnd_all_files.txt, README.md)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
